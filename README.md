# Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° API Detector

An extension to shine light on the Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° APIs web apps try to
use.

## How it works

### API data

The raw data for the different Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° APIs is curated in the
[fugu-api-data](https://github.com/tomayac/fugu-api-data/blob/main/README.md)
project, so keeping the list of APIs updated is a straightforward task
independent of the extension.

### API detection

The extension monitors the requests a page makes via the
[`chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest/#event-onBeforeRequest)
API. Each response body, grouped by main frame, JavaScript, and Web App Manifest
response bodies, is then run through a set of regular expressions like
`/navigator\.hid\.requestDevice\s*\(/g` to determine if the code hints at a
Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° API potentially being used.

### Browser support detection

Most Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° APIs are easily feature-detectable by checking for the
existence of interfaces or properties, for example, as in
`'BarcodeDetector' in window`. Other APIs require a
[`ServiceWorkerRegistration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration),
but luckily the popup window in
[Manifest V3 extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/)
uses a service worker, so it can be used via an IIFE that can be run in the
client or the service worker. An example is
`(async () => 'periodicSync' in (await navigator.serviceWorker?.ready || self.registration))()`.

The support categories are listed below:

- ‚úÖ Supported by your browser.
- üö´ Not supported by your browser.
- ü§∑ Support unknown for your browser. (The only way to know would be
  `user-agent` sniffing.)

### Deep-linking

The extension makes use of [Text Fragment URLs](https://web.dev/text-fragments/)
to deep-link to the occurrence of a detected API. The source code gets rendered
in a helper HTML page controlled by the extension, since it is impossible to
directly link to `view-source:` protocol links and non-document resources with
Text Fragment URLs.

## Limitations

- The
  [`chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest/#event-onBeforeRequest)
  API unfortunately does not "see" requests that are handled by a service worker
  ([crbug.com/766433](https://crbug.com/766433)). There are three possible
  workarounds for this:
  - Hard-reload via
    <nobr><kbd>‚åò</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd></nobr>.
  - Open DevTools and check the
    [Bypass for network](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/#:~:text=bypass%20for%20network)
    checkbox in the Service Worker section of the Application tab.
  - [Clear storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/#clear-storage)
    in the Storage section of the Application tab.
- The extension only does _static_ code analysis, that is, there is no guarantee
  that the app actually uses the code snippet where a Project Fugu&nbsp;üê° API
  was detected.
- Heavily minified code will not be detected. For example, if an app minifies
  `navigator.clipboard.write()` to
  `const nav = navigator; nav.clipboard.write()`, the extension will not detect
  this.
